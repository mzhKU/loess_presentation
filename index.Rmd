# Slidify Presentation of the Loess Fitting App #

## Introduction

[LOESS, originally proposed by Cleveland (1979) and further developed by Cleveland and Devlin (1988), specifically denotes a method that is also known as locally weighted polynomial regression.][id]

The weighting function is given by

$$ w(x) = (1- \left|x\right|^3)^3 I\left[\left|x\right| < 1\right]$$

where $I$ is the indicator function.

## Description of the app
The application allows to see how `span_value` affects the fit.
```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(ElemStatLearn); data(ozone)
ozone <- ozone[order(ozone$ozone), ]
span_value=0.2; n_pred = 20
sample_set            <- sample(1:n_pred, replace=TRUE)
ozone_sampled         <- ozone[sample_set, ]
ozone_sampled_ordered <- ozone_sampled[order(ozone_sampled$ozone), ]
loess(temperature ~Â ozone, data=ozone_sampled_ordered,
                          span=span_value, na.action=na.omit)
```

## Conclusion and Outlook

- During development, it was noticed that the locally used version of the application behaves differently from the online version. The reason for this is unknown
- A nice feature to have would be to allow downloading the Loess table
- Also it would be great if the user could select other variables to fit against each other

Thanks for having a look at my application and my presentation.
